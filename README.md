# TreeFunctions
Small program that allows the user to create a tree as an array, then traverse and perform actions on it, such as inverting it.



The user can input an array of values, which can be used either to create a binary tree, or a binary search tree. 


Then the tree can be traversed through using breadth-first search, or iterative/recursive versions of pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.


Finally, some additional functions have been implemented to gain extra information about the tree, such as its maximum depth, and the lowest common ancestor between two given nodes.
